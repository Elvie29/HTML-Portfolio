<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi, I'm Elvie, and I'm currently stuyding Web Development through The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu.
  I'm building my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and I'm excited to use what I've learned to create functional and user-friendly websites.</p>

<p>I enjoy exploring new technologies and solving problems with clean, efficient code. My focus is on building websites that works seamlessly and provide a great experience for users. Every project I work on is a chance to grow and refine my skils</p>

<p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy trying new recipes, relaxing with a good book, or taking time to recharge. I'm always eager to connect with others, share ideas, and collaborate on meaningful projects in web development. </p>
